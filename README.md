# 5-Reasons-Why-Your-Teen-Will-Love-Invisalign
Nothing will boost your teen’s confidence like a beautiful smile! However, not all teens want to go through the process of having metal braces on their teeth in order to straighten their bite. This is where Invisalign comes in. Here are just five of the many reasons why your teenager will love the Invisalign method.


1. They can have braces-free smiles in school photos.

One thing no teen wants is to have chunky metal braces on their teeth when they smile — particularly in the age of social media. Now, with Invisalign, your teen can improve their smile discretely. Invisalign aligners are made from a clear, durable plastic that is custom-made for them. Their friends won’t even notice they’re wearing them!

2. They can eat whatever they like.

Braces are particularly tricky because they come with a lot of food restrictions. With braces, you need to avoid eating any crunchy or hard foods, or you may risk damaging the device. Plus, many foods can get stuck in your brackets and wires, which is frustrating and embarrassing for a teenager. Therefore, one of the huge perks to having Invisalign is that you can take them out whenever you want! Your teen can just pop them off before they begin eating, and then slip them right back on when they’re done. Now, your teen can enjoy their favorite foods throughout their treatment without hassle.

3. Invisalign is helpful for kids who play sports.

There is always concern for the safety of your teenager’s teeth when they’re playing a physical sport. When teens have braces, there is the added concern of cutting their cheeks or lips on the device, as well as breaking a bracket during a game. Invisalign, on the other hand, is made from a durable material that won’t break easily. There is also the added benefit that Invisalign can even help to protect your child’s teeth during athletic activity, so they are less likely to need expensive dental repairs as a result of injury.

4. It is a low-maintenance treatment.

If there is one thing anyone can appreciate, it is orthodontic treatment that is simple and hassle-free. Invisalign requires viewer visits to the dentist’s office, as new aligners are delivered right to your door. And without brackets and wires, their teeth are easy to clean with Invisalign. Most importantly, your teen won’t have to change their lifestyle or diet throughout the process of their Invisalign treatment.

5. They’ll see results quickly!

With Invisalign, your teen can have a beautiful smile in half the time. This system has been known to align teeth in 50 percent of the time as other methods. Plus, they’ll start to notice changes in their smile within a matter of weeks. Your teen will absolutely love their new smile!
